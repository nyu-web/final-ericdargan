# Final Portfolio

For my final project I am building an online portfolio to showcase the different work I've done. This portfolio site will hold various types of media including photo, video, and potentially animation as well.

## Outline

### Home Page
The Home Page will be a simple landing page with my logo in the top left, and an image that fills the right side of the page. I am planning to do an unconventional nav bar, with links distributed across the page.

### About Page
The About page will most likely be a white background with a png photo of me, with a few introductory words to the right of it.

### Photo Gallery
For the photo gallery, I want to do something of a sea of photos that washes down as you scroll. Hoping to do an unbalanced layout using grid.

### Media Gallery
I'm hoping to do a full page video for this page.

### Blog
This blog will probably be on a three column grid that compresses down to less columns as the device gets smaller.
